# Run-Mania
A running app that generates a looping route for you based on the distance you set. 
Compete and challenge with your friends as you level up through running! 

## Scope of Project
A mobile application using React Native that generates suitable routes of a specific distance for running and logs them while having gamification features. 

## Motivation 
Ever felt unhealthy and have been putting on some weight? Unwilling to go for runs because of the same old route all the time? Perhaps during runs, you start to lose motivation as you run through the repetitive scenery just to clock your mileage. 

Most people can relate to such thoughts, having realised that they are out of shape. Everyone can acknowledge their lifestyle choices might not be the healthiest. However, after acknowledging, very few are willing to take it one step further to make changes in their lifestyle, citing reasons such as laziness or the lack of any incentives. Hence, we want to increase the conversion rate from acknowledgement to action. 

## Aim 
We hope to make an application that generates a route of X distance based on the user’s input in such a way that the user completes his/her jog in just one round and also having intentions to gamify the application to reach out to the gaming community. 

## User Stories
1. As a user, I have always found that repeated rounds around a park/stadium boring and tires me out faster, I want to be able to pick a route based on distance.
2. As a user, I want to be able to easily pick a new route of a longer distance as I progressively improve on running. 
3. As a user, I want to be able to compare with my friends.
4. As a user, I want to track and log all my runs, so that I can view them all in the future. 
5. As a friend, I want to be able to compare and compete against other friends.
6. As a user, I want to time my runs and and other information. 

## Features
### Auto-routing
The core feature of this application. Randomly generates a route of a specified distance, given by the user's input. The accuracy of this auto generation is set to ±250m from the user's input.

### Tracking of runs
Users will be able to track their real-time location and time elapsed as they run the route. 

### Running Logs
Users can view all their past runs that are logged in this application.

### Account features
All users can create an account which stores all running logs, friends, etc. To make changes to their account such as their username, email or password, they can do so in the settings page. 

### Leaderboard
This is where users can view the standings against other friends registered on this application. 

### Gamification
Earn experience by running! Required experience to level up is calculated by ( Current level * 2 ) kilometres. Level up to increase stats and get stronger in order to dominate your friends (and secure bragging rights!) in a real-time turn-based PvP combat.

### Settings
Allows users to edit their username, email or password.

- Google Maps
- Geolocation 

## System Design

### Backend
This application uses Firebase as its backend as well as its database. 

### Frontend
This application uses React Native in conjunciton with Expo's managed workflow to allow our app to be easily published and run on both android and iOS platforms.
