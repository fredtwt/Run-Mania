# Run-Mania
A running app that generates a route for you based on the distance you set. 
Compete and challenge with your friends as you level up through running! 

## Motivation 
Ever felt unhealthy and have been putting on some weight? Unwilling to go for runs because of the same old route all the time? Perhaps during runs, you start to lose motivation as you run through the repetitive scenery just to clock your mileage. 

Most people can relate to such thoughts, having realised that they are out of shape. Everyone can acknowledge their lifestyle choices might not be the healthiest. However, after acknowledging, very few are willing to take it one step further to make changes in their lifestyle, citing reasons such as laziness or the lack of any incentives. Hence, we want to increase the conversion rate from acknowledgement to action. 

## Aim 
We hope to make an application that generates a route of X distance based on the userâ€™s input in such a way that the user completes his/her jog in just one round and also having intentions to gamify the application to reach out to the gaming community. 

## User Stories
1. As a user, I have always found that repeated rounds around a park/stadium boring and tires me out faster, I want to be able to pick a route based on distance.
2. As a user, I want to be able to easily pick a new route of a longer distance as I progressively improve on running. 
3. As a user, I want to be able to compare with my friends.
4. As a user, I want to track and log all my runs, so that I can view them all in the future. 
5. As a friend, I want to be able to compare and compete against other friends.
6. As a user, I want to time my runs and and other information.
